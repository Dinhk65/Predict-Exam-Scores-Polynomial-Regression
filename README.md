# Predict-Exam-Scores-Polynomial-Regression
# 🎓 Student Score Prediction (Prototype) | ML(scikit-learn) + Backend + Frontend(Streamlit)
🚀 This is a prototype **student score prediction app** built using **Polynomial Regression**.  
It features a **full-stack architecture** with:  
✅ **Machine Learning (ML)** – Polynomial Regression for score prediction.  
✅ **Backend** – Flask API to serve the model.  
✅ **Frontend** – Simple web UI for input & visualization (Streamlit).  

⚠️ **Note**: This is a testing model. No hyperparameter optimization has been applied yet.
